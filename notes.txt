Backlog

Add poliicy to have a preapporved list of vendors - PENDING
propose policy to have a preapproved list of recurring items to purchase

(non-essential)add back navigation and forward navigation - PENDING - i.e as well as breadcrumbs to help the user identify
where they are

-put in a place a feature that can restrict a child from progressing to the
next grade(is there still such a thing as repeating a class?)-PENDING
-should not allow a child to be unregistered if they still have a balance,rather they should be deactivated
and the invoicer will skip all the students who are inactive

make the system refresh the token call upon login and keep refreshing every hour as long as the user is still active- MADE SYSTEM REFRESH
 TOKEN CALL ON LOGIN,i need a scheduler for thhat and that means celery (we need retry workflows so that we make sure that the data is persisted to quickbooks-POST PRESENTATION
 )


12/09/2022 System Notes
1.Academic Calendar app
> What happens when someone passes in a date to AcademicCalendar.get_term but we do not have a calendar for that year?
>AcademicCalendar.date_range should include the start and end dates in thr range list
>Check whether the date passed in as an argument is a valid date on all the methods on the modifiable
>

2.Account
>be sure to direct transactions to their respective accounts

>Ensure the synced flag is raised after you successfully save a qb_item



3. billItem
>Future feature, be able to make multiple bill items in one bill




>add form validation



4. bill_payment





9.invoice



9.student
>validate form

should not allow the student to subscribe to two of the same items
policy: subscription to lunch and transport should be done at the earliest, preferably beefore making any payment
any student taking lunch should make it known at the beginning of the term

deployment checklist:
    > Verify the academic calendar has the correct start and end dates of each term ACTUALLY
    >THE OPENING AND CLOSING DATES WILL BE INCLUDING THE HOLIDAYS FOR THAT TERM.SO FROM THE OPENING OF ONE TERM THE THE DAY PREVIOUS TO THE START OF THE NEXT TERM

 while doing form verification,ensure that the dates make sense, i,e cant put a date earlier/later



next time when developing, use selenium to simulate user activity on the browser, like filling forms and clicking buttons
to eliminate the need to have to manually simulate user activity

subscribing to items, the charges must be applied to the invoices for the current terms

should change the status of the invoice to unpaid when subscribing to items just in case the invoice was cleared
ypu should have only one invoice for a given term/year pair

it is critical that you validate the user's input! in all the applications



-make the sidebar stick to the top of the page and the rest of the page to scroll up and down
-add chart to show the distribution of unpaid fees per grade
-make sure to validate the bill form so that the price_per_quantity* amount = total
-and make sure to auto-calculate the total for the user


-add select 2.js to the record all recording forms

-hover dropdown- make sidebar button dropdown on hover - NON ESSENTIAL

-add export to pdf and csv buttons to tables

-dont forget the task that run at tevery beginning of the year, graduating students to the next grade
-and the scheduler that runs every beginning of the term to invoice the students


-use django-mailer to send emails
-make datatables load the most recent records first in all tables -important
-make total field in edit and record bill forms autocalculate
 - the student's active field will only prevent him from being invoices, but the systems should not allow his
- there's a bug in the mark bill as paid where the button is pointing to the first unpaid bill, not the current bill
which i want to pay


PRIORITIES:
1.SELECT2JS ON PAYMENT FORMS
2.EXPORT BUTTONS ON REPORT TABLES
3.DATATABLE CHATS ON DASHBOARD


Next time do test driven developments, and always make sure you write tests the next time you make a change or add
another feature

should make the submit button turn into a spinner to indicate loding
05/10/2022
-Invoice Payments are not being recorded
-Bills ar bing recorded with the incorrect date
-Invoicing is sending the wrong amount to quickbooks

- definitely use class based views next time

-- give the urls a more appealing urul scheme
- add accountant relevant charts and graphs to accountant dashboard
- datatables needs more attention- ordering , outputting reports,
-- FEATURE TO PRINT INVOICE DETAILS, WHICH INCLUDE PAYMENT HISTORY  
-- DISABLE THE USER FROM GOING BACK TO A CONFIRMATION MODAL TO SUBMIT ONCE FORM ONCE AGAIN
-- you can get insight into which info to represent as charts from  the tables in your pages e.g the bill category column can be represented 
    graphically by the use of a piechart


--REQUESTS SHOULD ALWAYS CHECK WHETHER THE API TOKEN IS STILL VALID
